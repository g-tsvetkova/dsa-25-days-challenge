    "I notice that the function must return a new array, therefore an out-of-place algorithm. We have a sorted array, which means that after squaring each element, the positive numbers preserve this property. However, for the case of negative numbers after the operation, their order is ascending (e.g. $[-4, -1] -> [1, 16]$). This motivates me to implement 2-step algorithm that first divides the arrays into two splits with positive and negative numbers and squares the numbers. Then having two sorted arrays reminds me of the merge strategy from merge sort. I will demonstrate why this is efficient for sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A: [a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}] \\\\\n",
    "B: [b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}, b_{4}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume $a_{1} < b_{1}$, then we know that between $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$, there could be other numbers from array A inbetween but if all $b_{i} > b_{1}$, then we cannot have a number from B filling that gap. Thus, we go and check the elements in A if they are less than $b_{1}$ because they for sure are bigger than $a_{1}$. Now, the merged array will start with $[a_{i}, b_{i},...]$. \n",
